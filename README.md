Maths trainer for a final java assignment - Programmeren module 1 @ LOI

Stuck at this final assingment, any help would be appriciated.

I need to give the RadioButtons on the keuzeScherm value so that the rekenSommen JFrame can generate the equations based on the selected radio button.
Also, I need to check if the answer given was correct or not and assing it to the Jpanel(voortgang).
